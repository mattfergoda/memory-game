# Memory Game
An in-browser memory game.  

To test the best/lowest-score functionality, update the value in `localStorage` from your browser's console: `localStorage.setItem('lowestScore-<number-of-cards>', Infinity)`, using the appropriate number of cards. A best score is stored for each possible number of cards.
